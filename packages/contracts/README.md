# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```

# Lottery Contract Test Report

The following summarizes the test results using Hardhat + Chai:

```bash
$ npx hardhat test

      âœ“ should revert if winner count is 0
      âœ“ should revert if winner count is 0
    buy

      âœ“ should revert if no participants
    views and utils
