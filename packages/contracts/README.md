# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```

# Lottery Contract Test Report

The following summarizes the test results using Hardhat + Chai:

```bash
$ npx hardhat test

  Lottery
    constructor
      âœ“ should revert if points address is zero
    createRound
      âœ“ should allow owner to create round
      âœ“ should revert if non-owner tries to create round
      âœ“ should revert if startTime >= endTime
      âœ“ should revert if reward is 0
      âœ“ should revert if winner count is 0
    buy
      âœ“ should allow user to buy and call consume()
      âœ“ should revert if roundId is invalid
      âœ“ should revert if amount is 0
      âœ“ should revert if round has not started
      âœ“ should revert if round has ended
      âœ“ should revert if deadline has passed
      âœ“ should revert if round is closed
      âœ“ should revert if ticketsToIssue is 0
    draw
      âœ“ should correctly draw winners
      âœ“ should revert if non-owner tries to draw
      âœ“ should revert if roundId is out of range
      âœ“ should revert if round has not ended
      âœ“ should revert if round is closed
      âœ“ should revert if no participants
      âœ“ should revert if winner count is 0
